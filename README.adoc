Filetype plugin for vimscript
=============================

This is a filetype plugin for vimscript files that specifies some (quite
personal) settings additionally to the default vimscript filetype plugin.


Folding
-------

A `foldexp` is defined that folds vimscript functions as level 1 and
leading http://github.com/google/vimdoc[vimdoc] comment blocks as level 2.

Additionally a custom foldtext is specified to display the first line of a
folded vimdoc comment block.

A command `DebugFoldExpr` and a corresponding function `vim#debug_foldexpr`
is provided to debug custom foldexpressions. This only works for
foldexpressions that are simple function calls (the 'foldexpr' must match
'.\+(v:lnum)$'). It displays the line number, the result of applying the
foldexpression and the actual content of each line in the current buffer.
This command / function also displays any error when evaluating the
'foldexpr'. Otherwise such errors are swallowed by vim.


Sourcing vimscript
------------------

Functions and mappings are provided to source the current vimscript file or
the visually selected lines:

- `vimscript#run()`
- `nnoremap go`
- `vnoremap go`
