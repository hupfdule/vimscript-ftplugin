Filetype plugin for vimscript
=============================

This is a filetype plugin for vimscript files that specifies some (quite
personal) settings additionally to the default vimscript filetype plugin.


Folding
-------

A `foldexp` is defined that folds vimscript functions as level 1 and
leading http://github.com/google/vimdoc[vimdoc] comment blocks as level 2.

Additionally a custom foldtext is specified to display the first line of a
folded vimdoc comment block.


Sourcing vimscript
------------------

Functions and mappings are provided to source the current vimscript file or
the visually selected lines:

- `vimscript#run()`
- `nnoremap go`
- `vnoremap go`
